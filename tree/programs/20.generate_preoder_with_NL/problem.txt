Generate a tree from its pre-order and its corresponding NL sequence. But the condition is that nodes in the tree have either 0 child or 2 children.

NL sequence is describing either the node is leaf node(L) or non-leaf node(N) for the same sequence of pre-order.

pre-order: 	1	2	4	5	3	6	7
NL:		N	N	L	L	N	L	L

Output:
1	
2	3	
4	5	6	7
