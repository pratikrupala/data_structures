Given an array of integers with size n, ideally the elements should be in the range 1 to n occuring exectly at once in the array. 

Instead if there are some other numbers present in the array then those many number from 1 to n range will be missing. Find first missing positive number from this array and print it.

Example,

{8, 4, -2, 1, 0, 6, 1, 3};
Missing number: 2

{8, 4, -2, 1, 2, 6, 1, 3};
Missing number: 5
