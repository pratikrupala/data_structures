For a given positive array in non-decreasing order, find the ceil and floor values for any given input number x.

The ceil value is the minimum value of an array element among the numbers greater than input number x.
Similarly, the floor value is the maximum value of an array element among the numbers less than the input number x.

Example,

{2, 4, 6, 7, 11, 16, 45, 56} and input number = 5
Floor value = 4
ceil value = 6

{2, 4, 6, 7, 11, 16, 45, 56} and input number = 98
Floor value = 56
ceil value = None

{2, 4, 6, 7, 11, 16, 45, 56} and input number = 1
Floor value = none
Ceil value = 2
