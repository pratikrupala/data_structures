Problem

While the most typical type of dice have 6
sides, each of which shows a different integer 1 through 6, there are many games that use other types. In particular, a dk is a die with k sides, each of which shows a different integer 1 through k. A d6 is a typical die, a d4 has four sides, and a d1000000

has one million sides.

Dice from sample case 1

In this problem, we start with a collection of N
dice. The i-th die is a dSi, that is, it has Si sides showing integers 1 through Si. A straight of length ℓ starting at x is the list of integers x,x+1,…,x+(ℓ−1)

. We want to choose some of the dice (possibly all) and pick one number from each to form a straight. What is the longest straight we can form in this way?
Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T
. T test cases follow. Each test case is described in two lines. The first line of a test case contains a single integer N, the number of dice in the game. The second line contains N integers S1,S2,…,SN

, each representing the number of sides of a different die.
Output

For each test case, output one line containing Case #x
: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y

is the maximum number of input dice that can be put in a straight.

Case #1: 4
Case #2: 5
Case #3: 9
Case #4: 1

In Sample Case #1, there are multiple ways to form a straight using all 4

dice. One possible way is shown in the image above.

In Sample Case #2, since none of the dice can show an integer greater than 5
, there is no way to have a straight with more than 5 dice. There are multiple ways to form a straight with exactly 5 dice. For example, pick the integers 4 and 5 for both d5⁠'s and then integers 1,2, and 3 for three of the d4⁠'s to form 1,2,3,4,5

.

In Sample Case #3, it is possible to form the straight 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
by discarding one d4 and using the d4⁠'s, d5, and d6 to get 1 through 4; the d7⁠'s to get 5 through 7; and the d10⁠'s to get 8 and 9. There is no way to form a straight of length 10

, so this is the best that can be done.

In Sample Case #4, we can only form a straight of length 1
, but we can do so by picking any integer for the d10 we are given.
